# System
__Workstation computer__: Linux Ubuntu

__Personal computer__: Use whatever you want (though most use Apple/Mac machines).

# Recommended Packages
__Mac__
* Package manager: [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

__Windows__

__All Operating Systems__
* Jupyter Notebook

# Version control
__Git__: [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/). We use [GitHub](github.com) heavily, which relies on Git.

# Language Guidelines

__Markdown__
* [General standard](http://commonmark.org/)

* [GitHub standard](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
This integreates with many of GitHub's services. Use this if you're writing for github.

* R Markdown ([home page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/))
Tool to integrate  writing professional papers with R code.


__LaTeX__: [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com)
* Creating Projects on sharelatex
  1. Get Pat's login credentials.
  2. Create the project from Pat Shafto's account
      * This is important so many people can work on the same document for free.
  2. _Then_, give yourself and collaborators access from Pat's account
  3. After people leave the lab, remove their privileges.

* Style: use 2 space tabs.

__MATLAB__
* MATLAB Version 2017a
* Psychtoolbox 3.0.14 “Standby FTL!”. 
  * Download from the Psychtoolbox [home page](http://psychtoolbox.org/)

__Python__
* If you are not using conda environments, installation instructions can be found
   [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/).
* Testing [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) for small scripts; unittest for packages.
* Style: [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  * [autopep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) 
     will automatically format your code to meet pep8 standard,
     wherever it is safe to do so.
  * [pep8 tool](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) will tell you where and what
     guidelines the code does not meet.
* Virtual Environments: [Conda Environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)
* Tabs vs. Soft tabs: use soft tabs (4 spaces).

__Javascript__
* Anderson/Wai Keen/Terri, please weigh in here.

__R__
* Wai Keen/Yue, please weigh in here.

__Other__
* If the lab has not agreed on a style guideline for a language, you get to do the research and decide.
* Browse [Google style guides](https://github.com/google/styleguide) and look for your language of interest.
* Search elsewhere for non-Google standards. Community accepted standards might be a lot different.
* Weigh the pros and cons of each style and present the issue in a lab meeting.
* Vote and decide.

# Writing Papers
The lab works on papers together by writing them in ShareLaTeX.
